### Description: Notes about TypeScript

## Compile TypeScript

*   If you don't have TypeScript installed in local project
    *   npx tsc fileName.ts
    *   This file gets converted to a JS file
    *   Before that happends, TS checkes file for errors
    *   Most errors will be seen in IDE before compilation

*   Typescript info
    *   Generic type only works in conjunction with another type (the connected type). You add the other type in the angle brackets <OtherType>
    

*   React with Typescript
    *   Typescript compilation will be part of build process for React (since react uses JSX which has to be converted to JS)
      
*   What to add types for in React
    *   Props
       * If using arrow function to define component, you can also use the FC type.
